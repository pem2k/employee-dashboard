## Description

This project uses oop methodology to create a team dashboard based on information submitted through the command line. Challenges in the project were mostly related to passing the role more times than I needed to. Once this was resolved, the project was smooth sailing.

## Installation

Please install the required dependencies listed in package.json via npm

## Usage

Once the required dependencies are installed, run the command "node index.js". You will be prompted for manager information, then have the choice to add interns and engineers to the manager's team. Once you exit the application, an index.html file will be generated with cards describing the information of each team member.
